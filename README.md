## Decisions:
- ### styled components:

- ### create-react-app:


- ### `.then()` and `.catch()`
  Just preference, Is the way I like to read Promises (and to avoid "Callback Hell").
  Also, there weren't so many chained promises(In fact there were none), if there was, I would've used `try` and `catch` to give a more "synchronous manner" to those promises.
